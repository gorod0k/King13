King Godric XIII, called the Crimson Hand, the Withering Flame, the dreaded King Thirteen rose from his throne.

The whispers of his subjects had grown too loud, too bold. They had forgotten their place.

— *Silence!*

Clad in blood-red armor, Godric towered over them, an enormous and imposing figure.

— *I am fear incarnate!* — his roar echoed through the hall. — *You will bow before me, or you will burn!*

Soon after, swords were drawn, and scarlet splattered the floor.
